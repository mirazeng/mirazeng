I'm a software engineer with expertise in AI, Machine Leaning, and Reinforcement Learning. My experience includes various optimized algorithms. I'm passionate about applying machine learning models to solve real-world problems.

I also specialize in developing scalable distributed systems, having worked with Kubernetes, Spring Boot microservices, and service mesh architecture. My full-stack development skills include React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and GraphQL

Currently, I'm looking to dive deeper into fintech, combining my experience with real-time data processing using Redis and Kafka with my interest in financial technology solutions. I enjoy creating technology that elevates people, and I'm excited about the intersection of AI and financial services.
